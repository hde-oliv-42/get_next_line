Once upon a midnight dreary,
While I pondered, weak and weary.
Over many a quaint and curious
Volume of forgotten lore.
While I nodded,
Nearly napping,
Suddenly there came a tapping.
As of some one gently rapping,
Rapping at my chamber door.
Tis some visitor,
I muttered,
Tapping at my chamber door.
Only this and nothing more.
Ah,
Distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December.
And each separate dying ember.
Wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow.
Vainly I had sought to borrow.
From my books surcease of sorrow.
Sorrow for the lost Lenore.
For the rare and radiant maiden.
Whom the angels name Lenore.
Nameless here for evermore.
