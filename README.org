#+TITLE: Get Next Line
#+AUTHOR: Henrique Rocha
#+DESCRIPTION: A function that reads a file descriptor per line.

** What it is
This project consists of a function that reads a line from a file descriptor and returns it, if it is called in a loop it must read the entire file without losing the reference.

** How to use it
Requisites:
#+begin_src
clang
#+end_src

Then you will need a main function that have access to a file descriptor, using open in a file for example:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	int	fd;
	char	*line; // Where the line will be stored

	fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
	while (get_next_line(fd, &line) == 1);
	{
		printf("%s", line);
		free(line); // Because the line is allocated on heap
	}
	return (0);
}
#+END_SRC
The return values are 1 (for line read), 0 (for EOF) and -1 (for error). So you can call it in a loop to print the entire file.

After that, compile it, defining the buffer size.
#+BEGIN_SRC c
clang -D BUFFER_SIZE=10 main.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
#+END_SRC c

And run it!
#+BEGIN_SRC c
./a.out text.txt
#+END_SRC
- The bonus version works the same, but it can handle multiple file descriptors.
